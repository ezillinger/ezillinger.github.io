## My Amazing Website

This static website is designed to be minimalist above all else. There is no Javascript, no frameworks, and the only external client-side resource is FontAwesome. 

I'm not a frontend developer and I hand wrote all the CSS. I'm sorry that it looks stupid on your phone/tablet/toaster.
