#### Day 46 - ???

Mexico isn't as terrifying as every American ever will tell you it is. In fact, Mexicans are really nice and if you make Spanish-esque sounds and wave your hands around like an idiot eventually they'll let you pitch a tent in their fire stations.

I rode from Ensenada to Guerrero Negro mostly uneventfuly before the heat, loneliness, and inability to effectively communicate with anyone got the best of me. I wasn't having fun anymore so I decided to hop on the bus and ride to the southern tip of Baja and chill on the beach for a bit. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next. I love Mexico but cycling in the heat really sucks. I also need to work on my Spanish because it turns out that being able to ask questions isn't very useful if you can't understand the response.
